# SANTIA toolbox
Local field potentials are neuronal recordings  of in vivo and in in vitro animal models that give insight into deep structures of the brain and their functions. As these recordings generate large volumes of data, their review in order to detect and deal with the presence of noise, becomes an arduous task. Therefore, the development of systems which automatize this process is of mayor importance.  To this aim, we developed SANTIA  (Sigmate Addition: a Neuronal Tool for Identification of Artifacts), an open source toolbox for labelling and training models to identify artifacts in these recordings.
